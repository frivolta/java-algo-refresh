Problem Characteristics - Backtracking for Permutations:

Identifying Permutations: Trying to list all possible orderings? Think "Backtracking for Permutations".
Array/Sequence: The problem involves an array or sequence of elements.
Unique Combinations: The problem requests unique orderings.
Complete Exploration: The need to explore every possible ordering or arrangement of elements.
Questions to Ask:

Duplication: Are there duplicated numbers in the array? If yes, the logic should handle it to prevent duplicated permutations.
Objective: Are you trying to find all possible orderings? If yes, backtracking will help enumerate all possibilities.
Examples of Suitable Problems:

List all unique permutations of a given array of numbers.
Find all possible arrangements of a string's characters.
Determine the total number of possible permutations for a given array.
When NOT to Use "Backtracking for Permutations":

If the problem can be solved with a greedy approach or simple mathematical operations.
If dynamic programming or other algorithms can efficiently solve the problem without generating all permutations.
Visualization:

Imagine walking through the input array. At each element:

Include the current element and recursively arrange the remaining elements.
Exclude the current element and move on.
The recursive approach will ensure all possible orderings are explored.

Key Takeaway:

Whenever you encounter a problem that asks for identifying all possible orderings or arrangements, consider the "Backtracking for Permutations" approach. It's a systematic method to enumerate all possibilities and is especially suited for problems where you need to explore all potential paths or solutions.
